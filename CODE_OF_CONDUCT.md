# Kids Python Cozy Camp Code of Conduct

This project is a friendly space for kids, families, and mentors to learn and create with Python. We want everyone to feel safe, welcomed, and encouraged.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, with a kid‑friendly tone. You can read the original at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, friendly, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Be kind and patient. Assume good intentions.
- Use welcoming language. Explain ideas gently.
- Celebrate questions and curiosity.
- Give helpful feedback; focus on the code, not the person.
- Respect different skill levels and backgrounds.
- Keep content kid‑appropriate: no swearing, graphic content, or bullying.
- Protect privacy: do not share personal information (addresses, phone numbers, school names, etc.).

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments.
- Trolling, flaming, or intentionally disruptive behavior.
- Sharing others’ private information without permission (“doxing”).
- Sexualized language or imagery of any kind.
- Any content or behavior that would make kids or families feel unsafe.
